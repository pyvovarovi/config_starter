To create a copy text button in a Markdown (.md) file, you can use the following code:

markdown
Copy code
<button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('Your text to copy')">Copy Text</button>
This code creates a button that, when clicked, copies the specified text to the clipboard using the Clipboard API. Replace 'Your text to copy' with the actual text you want to copy.

Please note that this button will work in most modern browsers, but may not be supported in older or less common browsers.
